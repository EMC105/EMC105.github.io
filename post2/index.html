    <th>To begin I want to get an idea of where my skill level, or lack thereof, is so I can really appreciate the progress I intend on making. Working on the ad I chose the first day we messed around with photo shop in class, was fun. I changed a ‘corona’ type writer ad into a corona beer add. To do this I added a picture of a corona bottle but didn’t erase the type writer, the ad claimed that coronas help writers so I merely changed the focus to convey that corona beer helps writers, so I got to experiment (poorly) with text boxes and moving, resizing, and cropping images which was choppy but I think was solid ground work, this all also helped to get used to utilizing different tabs for editing an image before I want to put it on the final product I’m working with. I realized through this that I really don’t know much just from the amount of tools I used versus the amount available to me so I look forward to experimenting further, I also hope to increase my ability and proficiency working with the layers.

    <td>today I just watched a few video tutorials, it’s amazing how the simplest alterations can completely change a pictures vibe and how it is interpreted by an audience. I couldn’t believe how simply distorting the color gradient of a picture made me think of completely different things, like a blue ish tint on a picture of someone on a mountains made me think of Colombia while bringing the tint to a more brown yellow shade changed that initial thought to Patagonia. The tutorials while basic did make me feel like I can see improving a lot in a short amount of time simply because I started out knowing nothing.

    <td>Before class I got to try some of the introductory basic skills I saw in the tutorials, I did feel more confident even in the small changes I was making, when I first tried to edit a picture everything was guess work whereas with this experimentation I made subtler changes but made them more consciously and specifically which was cool.

    <p>
    <td> I changed the color scheme to black and white, I also got rid of someone’s watch by copying a section of their skin using the magic wand and pasting a copy of it over where the watch would be (seems round-about but it was effective) I also added font and changed the eye color with the paint tool. I realize these aren’t giant feets and I guess I knew a little about these simple procedures before but once again I was using them in a more concise way which I think will be the theme of my improvements, I want to learn a lot of new skills but like anything I think I need to master what I know slightly first before moving on so that may impede my schedule as seen in my prelim curriculum.

    <p>
    <td>I took 1 picture of the forest and tried to shift the light so I could have one that made it look taken in the morning, evening, and night. I discovered it’s way harder to capture day and night effectively than it is to just give the picture a new shade, with a new shade you and the audience know that the color is fake, so I found it way more difficult to maintain the realness of the picture while shifting the light. It’s weird to say but I feel like my skill will be marked by how well I can trick my audience?

    <p>
       <td>I tried editing someone into a picture, another skill I want to get my starting point at. I realized its super hard not only in the act of cutting the person out correctly but in making the image I put the person in to look natural. I had trouble because it was hard to find a picture that had similar lighting and to size everything correctly was difficult. It ended up looking pretty obvious but now I know I want to look into more tutorials that take you step by step in accomplishing a successful photoshop, I imagine learning to shadow well will go a long way in trying to make a picture look more organic the goal being to have the photo shopped image be hard to pick out, but that may take a while.
