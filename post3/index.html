    <p>
    <th>This week I really want to delve into how advertising and marketing firms utilize photoshop. I know it is a heavily used tool in digital media for commercials and adds, while I don’t have very much interest in how it is used on people to create “ideal” body types, I am interested in ways in which campaigns are brainstormed and pitches are created. So today I started by watching videos and reading articles. One of my favorite articles displayed a Photoshop campaign that used it to bring joy to commuters! There was a bus stop and a cross the street a car with a hidden camera took pictures and the photoshop guru would display fun photoshoped images with the commuters in them on an lcd screen at the bus stop! That’s the kind of whimsical fun I would like to create using photoshop.

<tr><td>10:00am-12:00pm</td>   <td>2/25/18</td>    <td>Improving ads</td>
    <p>
    <td>Today I wanted to use new skills I’ve learned to improve ads that already exist. I realized the point was to give ads a happier vibe. I first used an Adidas add. It was a picture of the logo sitting on sand with a black back ground. I decided that a happier vibe would be a sunny day at the beach. To do this I took another picture of a beach and cropped the sky into the Adidas ad. In order to keep it realistic adding the sun meant adding a shadow, I tried to copy the sign paste it and change the color to a faded shadowy look and reflected it on the sand. I feel like the idea was good but shadows have proven hard to create so that’s something I really want to work on in the future. The second ad I used was a smart water ad that used the moto “inspired by the clouds” the ad had no clouds in it, so I put clouds in the back ground and also tried to whimsical it up by adding glasses to the clouds for “smart water” I even tried to make one of the clouds into the shape of Einstein’s hair which was difficult but fun.

<tr><td>3:00pm-5:00pm</td>    <td>2/26/18</td>    <td>Logo Alteration Practice</td>
    <p>
    <td>Today I wanted to work with logos in particular and while not necessarily improving them just messing around with different color schemes and fonts to see how those things affect the look and feel of the ad. I altered the colors and back grounds of a coke and pepsi logos to see how their message changed, I realized both of them created a huge image for themselves, the pepsi logo is so simple it’s just a circle split into 3 almost like waves at a beach but now whenever I see a circle like that I think of pepsi, I realized even those colors just scream pepsi, because when I changed the colors of the add no matter what the circle maintained its pepsi association but changing the colors made the biggest impact. Coca-cola in that same way, they just used a font and sort of claimed it, whenever that font is used you think of coke, and changing that font really changed the cool old fashion feel of coke.

<tr><td>2:00pm-4:00pm</td>   <td>2/27/18</td>   <td>Videos on Animation</td>
    <p>
    <td> Today I watched videos on creating animation in photoshop. The way to start is with a timeline which is sort of like a flip book. My plan for tomorrow is to make a very simple sun rise sun set animation. I feel like altering the shade of the sky as I move the sun up and across the photo will be an easy gradual change that in a flip book like timeline will show the change in day to night. What I realized is how difficult it would be to make a very accurate and realistic animation considering how intricate and subtle each change would have to be in order for a smooth movement.

<tr><td>10:00am-12:00pm</td>   <td>2/28/18</td>   <td>Annimation Practice</td>
    <p>
    <td>During the animation process using the timeline feature was actually pretty complicated I feel like I just really got the hang of using layers with normal photoshop but adding the attempt to create animation made it a lot more challenging, I just had to be very careful and particular, something I realized is a key feature in creating successful photoshop content. I think my plan though for the design, the sun rising and setting in a very opening animated and fictional way was a good decision. It was a simple idea and I was being very obvious with my audience that I wasn’t trying to make it fancy or realistic so I could really focus on the principles of creating moving animation with very simple features to work with.
