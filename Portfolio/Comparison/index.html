      <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <div class="normal">
         Why did you choose this particular comparison? Would the comparison be more effective with more revisions? If so, what revisions?

<p> &nbsp; For this prompt I will be talking about one of the first class work assignments we worked on with photo shop. For this assignment I chose to take an old Corona type writer ad and turn it into a Corona beer ad and to do this I made a lot of choices as they pertain to how much change I wanted to make, and how I wanted the ad to be perceived. One choice I made had to do with if I wanted to keep the entire ad black and white and introduce a corona bottle as a splash of color to draw the eye to the product or If I wanted to keep the black and white color almost satirically because obviously today people see type writer and are already this must be a joke so I rolled with that and decided to match the black and white newspaper ad look with the corona as well. If I had the time or ability to make more revisions, I would love to transform the actual photo of the corona bottle into the same old fashion print drawn way that the typewriter was drawn so I could match the newspaper ad idea completely. <p> 
&nbsp; I was also not sure if I wanted the arm that was holding the bottle to match the suit wearing arm thatâ€™s holding the type writer or show a more casual arm as to say combine your work side with your casual beer drinking side. I liked the idea of having the two side of the personality so I made the arm more casual so the arms not wearing a long sleeve or a suit just a bare arm, and to add to this I added a small circle with the Pulitzer prize so as to say the beer will help your writing! Which was the approach I was making.
