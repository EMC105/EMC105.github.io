      <h2>Genre & Audience</h2>
        <div class="normal">
        An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience? <p>

For this question I will focus on my Work in Progress 2 submission, my garage band file. When I made it I pictured an audience of my friends, people who have shared my specific experiences for one thing, and who I know are feeling nostalgic about those experiences. With this in mind I was able to ignore some of the more conventional aspects of music such as melody and beat so I could focus more on the story and the real albeit condensed flow of a regular day. 
I think if I were to reimagine the idea, I would like to make it more rhythmic and catchy. To do this I think I would keep some of the more obvious “tail gate” themed elements such as the bottle opening and the fizz and maybe even the ping pong balls and specific bouts of laughter but I would treat these elements as individual beats that I could work into more concise measures to create a more song like file. I think adding those elements to a regular track of bass beats and instrumental features would be a cool song while still maintaining the theme of the day I chose. I imagine for someone who appreciates music or who doesn’t, a catchy rhythm is never a bad thing and it would allow for a more universal audience.
