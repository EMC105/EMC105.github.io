         An example of something you are particularly proud of? <p>

   &nbsp; 	This is going to seem odd, but one thing I was particularly proud of was a very quickly made logo we made during class. One might look at it and see it as semi sloppy and unimpressive but what I really like about it is how easily the process was. When I think back to the beginning of the year I was so uncomfortable with photoshop and thinking in a digital media way was so foreign to me that I would dread class assignments because it felt like everyone else had such good ideas and made so much progress so fast while I would sit there in disbelief just trying to cut an image or even pick one of your prompts to use. The difference with this piece of class work was how sort of fun it was, I remember really quickly opening a few different photoshop windows skimming the options and with each one I could quickly generate a platform of an idea until I stumbled upon the wrestling logo and was super confident in my desire to work with that one. I threw a few different pictures into a few tabs so I could work with them each individually before I meshed them and I thought about concepts like audience, the wrestling fans that would see this, the idea of contrast before I made the action figure black and the type face red, I was able to get the images somewhat where I wanted to in the short amount of time we had and while the product is far from clean or usable at this point I didn’t fully dismiss it as soon as I walked out of class as garbage I could see it being edited into something cool. It was made in a way that I felt confident in which just made me realize how much I have learned. So that is why I am particularly happy with it.<p>
    &nbsp; As far as editing if I was to edit it in the future, I would definitely clean it up, I would have the words behind the action figure and as to make it more easily uable maybe cut it so not as much of his leg is in it, I would also change the font to more crazy Wrestling chaos like type, and would even potentially do some experimenting with maybe instead of having the world in the c maybe I’d have it on his belt. I really do just think it’s cool that I can even imagine doing those things.
