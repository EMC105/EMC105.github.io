      <h2>Visual Mode</h2>
        <div class="normal">
          An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode? <p>
         &nbsp; I made very specific size, color, font, and content decisions on my home page that I will discuss for this prompt. I utilized a white background so that I could have a lot of blank white space as to make the aesthetic clean and in no way over whelming. With white as a background I used a very light almost pastel rainbow color scheme. I enforced the color scheme primarily in the menu on the home page and then when it came to the headings, links, and footnotes, on others. I really liked the rainbow element because it made my site very happy, and in a way youthful, a sort of fun child-like nature is a big part of my personality. Also for the home page specifically I didn't add any boarders, I really liked the free floating undefined nature and how it comes across as a simple easy going feature. <p>
&nbsp; Another fun child esk decision I made was to have my boarders in varied polkadot patterns. On my home page the right boarders on my menu have a polka dot/ dashed appearance and on my other pages all of the boarder-styles for links and text boxes are dots. If I didn’t plan on working with kids in my future, I think I would have made some different design choices, and if I was attempting to show this to a more “serious” audience I think would have worked harder to make the site more structured and less welcoming in a way. I think my site aesthetic is simple and non-threatening but a ”cooler” design focus for me would probably consist of a background image and bolder less colorful colors and static elements.  <p>
&nbsp;Aside from a child-like nature, more in the mode of representing myself as a “web designer” I really liked Courier New as a font because it reminded me of the type on an old typewriter and as far as technological skill coming into this class, that time period is about where my ability to code mirrored. I love the clean, minimalist, and reminiscent of the past idea the font portrays. This also became really cool when I decided to animate the “Welcome” on my home page, watching it type out just seems really fun and while it didn’t take much skill I feel it sort of shows the progress I have made, I wouldn’t even have attempted that in the beginning.
