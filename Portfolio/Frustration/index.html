      <h2>Frustration</h2>
        <div class="normal">
An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked? <p>
&nbsp; Getting my website off of the ground was a very difficult process that took a lot of time to kick start. I feel I really did ride the learning curve when it came to effectively and relatively efficiently utilizing HTML and CSS, and not only that but understanding how the languages worked in a bigger picture sense. What stinks is when I finally reached that curve though, what took so much time, was the initial formatting and while I did finally accomplish laying out some sort of semi functional foundation, I did it in a way that caused a lot of trouble later on. When I finally did feel I knew what I was doing and knew some things I wanted to accomplish my skeletal structure made those goals way more complicated to achieve than they should have been. I really did not utilize <Div>’s or class’s efficiently and in trying to make simple things work I added a lot of unnecessary code that later I was afraid to sort through due to the fear that I would mess with what I finally made even remotely “work” or look how I wanted it to. <p>
         
&nbsp; The issues my uninformed and somewhat impulsive building procedures brought about include, a very messy and unorganized group of github files, obviously the fore mentioned non-essential elements of my HTML and CSS codes, and among other things very unstable pages as they pertain to window size and object relative positions. These issues didn’t occur to me when I was first building but in hindsight it was really frustrating to run into them. While I am happy with my site regardless of the problems I mentioned, just considering where I started and where I am now, I think the only way to remedy the situation would be to start building a new site from scratch. This would enable me to use what I know now to create a more stable and ideal structure off which to grow.
