       <div class="normal">I want my website to be fun, creative, and light. I think a lot of white space and colorful fonts are some
        things I can utilize to keep my website light but also professional and clean. As far as ease of use, I want to have my main menu
        on every page so people can navigate freely without having to use the back arrow on their browser, I also like when the menu comes
        with you if you scroll down the page. I think websites are memorable when they are subtly whimsical as well as personable, I like 
        when a website is done well but it doesn’t look as if done by a team at a corporation, I appreciate a bit of very organized 
        slightly random design themes. For this website the audience, aside from you Professor Lavin, is whoever I tell about it to therefore
        I feel comfortable making it as personal as possible so as to give the audience a true understanding of me, the purpose being 
        to help people get to know me through how I design it. I pretty much want the entire website design to show my style and 
        personality while the content inside the website will display my ability and competence. I think I’d like my brand to combine
        the themes: uniquely quirky and whimsically personable. I’d like to accomplish this by means of adding things that most websites
        don’t have like a quote, joke, riddle or fact of the day at the end of the home page. Small things like that always make me feel
        more welcomed on a website and welcoming is definitely something I would want my viewers to feel. </div>
