Help Wanted: Bike Messenger
<p>
Credentials: ability to ride a bike
<p>
Desired characteristics: 5 feet 7 inches tall.
<p>
Job description: I am requesting someone to ride my bike from my apartment to the cathedral of learning each morning. You see the problem is, I live downhill from the cathedral and would rather not have to bike uphill in the morning on my way to class, but after classes each day riding downhill would be very ideal. A bike messenger is one who makes deliveries while riding a bike, so I am essentially requesting a bike messenger to deliver my bike while riding my bike. The reason I would prefer the employee to be 5’7’’ is simply because I am 5’7’’ and I would hate to have to reposition the seat whenever I rode it home. This would be a very important job, upon applying for the position I would need a video of the applicant riding uphill, and would also need a picture of their bike, this would be necessary to ensure the candidate treats his bike similarly to how I would want him or her to treat mine. 
<p>
Salary: Other than the very healthy exercise that you would be required to partake in each day, I will also pay 1 dollar for each ride, so 5 dollars a week.
