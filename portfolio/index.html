        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         Everyone knows that Iâ€™m writing this, so abiding by the norm that dictates 'about me' statements be written in the
         third person feels very deceptive. In that same effect I will now do my best to describe myself as honestly as 
         possible. My name is Emma Cichocki, I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, and my future plans involve
         working with kids. I was the girl who would go to a friends house and say yes when their little sibling asked to 
         hang out with us, I was the girl who never said no to a babysitting job because I honestly had as much fun with the
         kids I babysat as the kids my age, and I was the girl who my friends stopped asking to cover their babysitting shifts 
         for because on more than one occasion the family's I would sub in for would start calling me instead of their original 
         babysitter. I feel I excel in areas such as creativity, whimsicality, and innovation all of which I intend 
         on channeling directly into making a future of making children smile everyday in one way or another. I am very 
         intersted in advirtising and I truly believe that my extensive experience with kids could help to make me a very 
         integral part of any team set out to promote a kid targeted product or brand.
